                <h2>January's pick</h2>
                <p class="colonne1">Dear,</p>
                  <p class="colonne1">You were astoundingly <span class="hvr-buzz-out">beautiful</span> on that night. I’m so anxious for meeting you again that I can’t wait to share with you my remarks on your graduation ball, how beautiful, heavenly and sublime you looked. You seemed to be floating arond the hall while everyone else was tied to the ground, the orchestra particularly made for you.
                  When I got into the place I almost immediately saw you and I knew for sure what I was about to experience. What a gorgeous woman I thought! That dress perfecly surrounding your body and you dancing so gracefully and beautifully I thought that had to be one of the rarest of things I´d ever have the privilege to see in this life... Honestly, on that moment I lost my voice, there I was with my mouth open like an idiot watching your show...
                  When you gave me the opportunity to dance with you that waltz, I could hardly believe that that was really happening to me, it seemed there was no one but us dancing in the room, a true perfect couple! It was thrilling and exciting what I felt that night. It was your princess day and I was the luckiest vassal, the happiest man in the party.
                  Expressing myself in such a formal way, you may be not recognizing me. But it was your majestic presence and not the suit and tie that transformed me in such a gentleman, the last romantic guy in the world.

                  All right, I'm just prattling, that's all gibberish, it shouldn´t be this hard to tell you how much I love you!</p>

                <p class="colonne4">Dear,</p>
                  <p class="colonne4">If I were your boyfriend I would be very happy and proud to have someone as special as you by my side; and I think you would also be happy to have someone as devoted as me to 'pamper' you and give you presents on the 14th of February... But I am not your boyfriend... so much for taking you for a walk or lunch and maybe even dinner; the chances of inviting you on a date, like having an ice cream, followed by movies and popcorn are pretty remote; and the opportunity to offer you this wonderful perfume that someone has just tested on me is very slim. You know that I would never say or do something that might be misunderstood. Being someone`s girlfriend or boyfriend is very different from being just friends (although they may not always remain like that, right?) But, as I was saying, if I were your boyfriend and you were my girlfriend, I would invite you to spend the weekend with me; we could go sailing on a boat of a friend of mine. Or maybe we could get one of those airline promotions and go to Rio de Janeiro, I heard it`s beautiful! Yes... it`s a shame you are not my girlfriend... But there is still some time till the 14th of February, right? Just give it a thought. I leave with a kiss from your 'just' friend.</p>

                <p class="colonne5">For a nice girl,</p>
                  <p class="colonne5">I thought it was really nice of you to have given me your e-mail so that I could send you a little message. Besides, you are nothing but nice... 
    And although I know you so little (after all, we only chatted that day), I`m not afraid to say that you are something else. 
    I`m curious : you are nice, intelligent, educated and elegant, why did you also have to be this beautiful ? 
    What I`m about to say is not blasphemy. I respect all Godly things but I believe that He had to sketch an entire human race before He drew you. And when He found the formula, in His loud and celestial voice He said : “Speak!” 
    And you did. And the most impressive bit of this story is that, since then, you`ve only spoken intelligent, charming things. Look (name), I would like to see you again. And again and again. Soon. Call me or send me a reply.</p>

    <p class="colonne6">Dear,</p>
    <p class="colonne6">Having someone like you by my side makes me feel protected from all the dangers you may come across around each corner of the world. Having you close by makes me feel capable of walking all the paths life puts before me, for there’s no evil that can resist a heart filled with love and inflated with the optimism and hope only a great love can bring...
    I know that all tracks I walk by your side will be good ones. I know that all steps I take next to you will be the right ones towards absolute happiness. And that's because I can feel the strength of love, decency, friendship, honesty and all the virtues with a simple touch of your hand or when you look at me.
    You make me look at the future with the certainty that happiness is possible and that we should not fear any obstacles. Because we will always find a way out of any difficulties if we keep our hearts filled with this greater feeling called love, a love that means solidarity, companionship and faith in life. You convince me of that. That and a lot more, because there’s nothing better in the world than to feel loved and wanted...
    Take this letter as a confirmation of the immense love I feel for you and for your noble spirit, strength, feelings and beauty that are kept in their essence. </p>
    <p class="colonne6">Tender kisses</p>

    You are able to offer all possible pleasures. You have charm, elegance and are always beautiful and fragrant. I will never hurt you. On the contrary: I'll love you forever and I’ll give you all my love.
    My desire for you will never end, because my body is only happy when I feel the warmth of your perfumed skin. I'm dying to hear your voice very close to my ears.

    <p class="colonne8">Sometimes I catch myself thinking of your smart talk, those genius hints on every subject that only you can come up with... Falling in love with you was not unjustified, you are a confident and intelligent man, you don't feed only on newspapers like most men nowadays. 
    You have a remarkable personality, and your education clearly comes back then from the cradle. You also have a strong disposition that helps you to succeed in your undertakings. Your future life will never be a mere repetition of the pas. Your creativity doesn't rely only on things kept in memory. 
    You don´t worry about keeping what you gain. You think that living the present is more important than saving for the future. You trust on what´s life has been keeping for you. You are certainly a differentiated person and I´m still in love with you for all of it. 
    I believe you can make my dreams come true, ever since the day I met you you´ve been soothing my heart, even if you don´t recognize it... My heart pulses only for you, and this simple letter expresses my admiration and all those things that I haven´t had the courage to talk to you, but you better know it´s all where it should be: inside my heart. </p>
