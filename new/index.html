                <h2>January's pick</h2>
                <p class="colonne1">Dear,</p>
                  <p class="colonne1">You were astoundingly <span class="hvr-buzz-out">beautiful</span> on that night. I’m so anxious for meeting you again that I can’t wait to share with you my remarks on your graduation ball, how beautiful, heavenly and sublime you looked. You seemed to be floating arond the hall while everyone else was tied to the ground, the orchestra particularly made for you.
                  When I got into the place I almost immediately saw you and I knew for sure what I was about to experience. What a gorgeous woman I thought! That dress perfecly surrounding your body and you dancing so gracefully and beautifully I thought that had to be one of the rarest of things I´d ever have the privilege to see in this life... Honestly, on that moment I lost my voice, there I was with my mouth open like an idiot watching your show...
                  When you gave me the opportunity to dance with you that waltz, I could hardly believe that that was really happening to me, it seemed there was no one but us dancing in the room, a true perfect couple! It was thrilling and exciting what I felt that night. It was your princess day and I was the luckiest vassal, the happiest man in the party.
                  Expressing myself in such a formal way, you may be not recognizing me. But it was your majestic presence and not the suit and tie that transformed me in such a gentleman, the last romantic guy in the world.

                  All right, I'm just prattling, that's all gibberish, it shouldn´t be this hard to tell you how much I love you!</p>

Those two pearls that make your face even more enchanting, that way, looking at you is always inevitable to me. Your eyes look as if they behold a magic power, because they shine like a cosmic ray that’s crossing the universe, capable of giving light to all the darkness in the universe. You know I’ve been meaning to tell you all this for a while now, but I was in doubt every time I stopped to think about how you could react, especially when I revealed my wish to look in your lovely eyes each time closer.
    Well; I got some courage and so I ask: would you like to go out for some ice-cream or coffee sometime?</p>

                <h2>October's pick</h2>
                <p class="colonne4">Dear,</p>
                  <p class="colonne4">If I were your boyfriend I would be very happy and proud to have someone as special as you by my side; and I think you would also be happy to have someone as devoted as me to 'pamper' you and give you presents on the 14th of February... But I am not your boyfriend... so much for taking you for a walk or lunch and maybe even dinner; the chances of inviting you on a date, like having an ice cream, followed by movies and popcorn are pretty remote; and the opportunity to offer you this wonderful perfume that someone has just tested on me is very slim. You know that I would never say or do something that might be misunderstood. Being someone`s girlfriend or boyfriend is very different from being just friends (although they may not always remain like that, right?) But, as I was saying, if I were your boyfriend and you were my girlfriend, I would invite you to spend the weekend with me; we could go sailing on a boat of a friend of mine. Or maybe we could get one of those airline promotions and go to Rio de Janeiro, I heard it`s beautiful! Yes... it`s a shame you are not my girlfriend... But there is still some time till the 14th of February, right? Just give it a thought. I leave with a kiss from your 'just' friend.</p>

                <h2>September's pick</h2>
                <p class="colonne5">For a nice girl,</p>
                  <p class="colonne5">I thought it was really nice of you to have given me your e-mail so that I could send you a little message. Besides, you are nothing but nice... 
    And although I know you so little (after all, we only chatted that day), I`m not afraid to say that you are something else. 
    I`m curious : you are nice, intelligent, educated and elegant, why did you also have to be this beautiful ? 
    What I`m about to say is not blasphemy. I respect all Godly things but I believe that He had to sketch an entire human race before He drew you. And when He found the formula, in His loud and celestial voice He said : “Speak!” 
    And you did. And the most impressive bit of this story is that, since then, you`ve only spoken intelligent, charming things. Look (name), I would like to see you again. And again and again. Soon. Call me or send me a reply.</p>
